# Summary
PyDepGraph is a Python package designed to address the need for effective dependency management within Python projects. As projects grow in complexity, understanding and maintaining the integrity of the codebase becomes increasingly challenging. PyDepGraph provides a comprehensive visualization of the dependency structure within Python projects, enabling developers to better understand and manage these dependencies.
The package utilizes existing libraries and tools, such as Pipdeptree, Echarts Graph, Streamlit, and NetworkX, to collect, visualize, and analyze dependency data. PyDepGraph is built on the principles of open-source development and aims to enhance the understanding and analysis of Python projects for developers and researchers alike.
With its user-friendly interface, scalability, and cross-platform compatibility, PyDepGraph is accessible to a wide range of users. Its integration with Astropy units and coordinate systems ensures that it can be easily used in both research and educational settings.
PyDepGraph employs mathematical concepts such as graph theory and community detection algorithms to analyze and visualize dependency data. By identifying clusters of interconnected packages, it helps developers and researchers understand the complexity and interdependencies of the packages used in their projects.
In summary, PyDepGraph is a valuable tool for managing and visualizing dependencies within Python projects, providing insights that can aid in debugging, optimization, and knowledge discovery about the project's architecture.


## 1. Introduction

Python is a popular programming language widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, and machine learning. As Python projects grow in complexity, managing dependencies between packages becomes increasingly challenging. To address this issue, I present PyDepGraph, a web application designed to visualize the dependencies within Python projects.

## 2. Functions
### 2.1 Dependency Data Collection

PyDepGraph utilizes Pipdeptree, a command-line tool, to collect dependency information from Python projects. Pipdeptree reads the project's `requirements.txt` file or its pip-compatible dependencies and generates a tree structure representing the relationships between packages. The tree structure is defined as follows:
$$
  \text{{tree}}(P) = \{p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n\}
$$
where $P$ is the root package and $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ are its dependent packages.

### 2.2 Visualization
The collected dependency data is visualized using Echarts Graph, an interactive graphing library. Echarts Graph represents the dependency tree as a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices (packages) and $E$ is the set of edges (dependencies between packages). The visualization helps developers understand the complexity and interdependencies of the packages in their project.

### 2.3 Web Application Development
PyDepGraph incorporates a web application developed with Streamlit, a modern Python library for building web apps. The web application provides an interactive interface for displaying the dependency visualizations and allows users to explore the relationships between packages.

### 2.4 Community Detection
To identify communities within the dependency graph, PyDepGraph employs the Girvan-Newman algorithm, which is part of the NetworkX library. The Girvan-Newman algorithm detects communities by iteratively removing edges with the highest betweenness centrality until the graph is decomposed into disconnected components. The betweenness centrality of an edge $e$ is defined as:
$$
  bc(e) = \sum_{s \neq t \neq e} \frac{\sigma_{st}(e)}{\sigma_{st}}
$$
where $\sigma_{st}$ is the number of shortest paths between vertices $s$ and $t$, and $\sigma_{st}(e)$ is the number of those paths that pass through edge $e$.

## 3. Development Principles
### 3.1 Modularity

PyDepGraph is designed with modularity in mind, separating different functionalities into distinct components. This modular approach simplifies maintenance, updates, and the addition of new features.

### 3.2 Integration
The tool seamlessly integrates existing libraries and tools, such as Pipdeptree, Echarts, Streamlit, and NetworkX, to create a cohesive application.

### 3.3 User Interface
The web application developed with Streamlit emphasizes a user-friendly interface, enabling users to interact with the dependency data and explore the relationships between packages.

### 3.4 Scalability
PyDepGraph is built to handle projects of various sizes, from small to large, without significant performance degradation.

### 3.5 Data Processing
The tool processes the raw dependency data to generate meaningful visualizations, ensuring that the insights provided are accurate and actionable for developers.

### 3.6 Cross-platform Compatibility
The web application is designed to be compatible with different platforms, making it accessible from any device with a web browser.

## 4. Conclusion
By combining its functions and development principles, PyDepGraph aims to provide developers with a comprehensive tool for understanding and analyzing the dependency structure of their Python projects. This tool can aid in debugging, optimization, and knowledge discovery about the project's architecture. Future work will focus on adding more features and improving the performance of PyDepGraph to better serve the Python community.
